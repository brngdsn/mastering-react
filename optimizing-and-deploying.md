---

**[Opening Scene]**

*Welcome back to the final video of our "Mastering React" series! In this episode, we'll focus on optimizing your Task Manager App for better performance and learn how to deploy it so others can access it. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a production-ready React application live on the web.*

### **1. Performance Optimization**

#### **- Code Splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`**

**What is Code Splitting?**

- **Definition:** Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your code into various bundles, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.
- **Why Use It?**
  - Improves performance by reducing the initial load time.
  - Only loads the code necessary for the current user interaction.

**Implementing Code Splitting**

1. **Import `React.lazy` and `Suspense`:**

   ```jsx
   import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Convert Components to Lazy-Loaded:**

   - Replace regular imports with `React.lazy`.

     ```jsx
     const Header = lazy(() => import('./components/Header'));
     const Tasks = lazy(() => import('./components/Tasks'));
     const AddTaskForm = lazy(() => import('./components/AddTaskForm'));
     ```

3. **Wrap Components with `Suspense`:**

   - Use `Suspense` to display a fallback UI while the component is loading.

     ```jsx
     // src/App.js
     function App() {
       const [showAddTask, setShowAddTask] = useState(false);

       return (
         <div className="container">
           <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
             <Header
               onAdd={() => setShowAddTask(!showAddTask)}
               showAdd={showAddTask}
             />
             {showAddTask && <AddTaskForm />}
             <Tasks />
           </Suspense>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that `Suspense` wraps around all lazy-loaded components.
- The `fallback` prop can be any React element, such as a spinner or loading message.

#### **- Memoization with `React.memo` and `useMemo`**

**Why Memoization?**

- **Purpose:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders by caching the result of a component or function based on its inputs.
- **Benefit:** Improves performance, especially for components that render large lists or perform heavy computations.

**Using `React.memo`**

1. **Wrap Functional Components:**

   - For components that receive props but do not need to re-render unless props change.

     ```jsx
     // src/components/Header.js
     import React from 'react';

     const Header = ({ title, onAdd, showAdd }) => {
       // component code
     };

     export default React.memo(Header);
     ```

2. **Understanding When to Use It:**

   - Best used on pure components that render the same output given the same props.

**Using `useMemo`**

1. **Import `useMemo`:**

   ```jsx
   import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Optimize Computations:**

   - For expensive calculations inside a component.

     ```jsx
     const Tasks = () => {
       const { tasks } = useContext(TaskContext);

       const sortedTasks = useMemo(() => {
         return tasks.sort((a, b) => a.day.localeCompare(b.day));
       }, [tasks]);

       return (
         <>
           {sortedTasks.map((task) => (
             <Task key={task.id} task={task} />
           ))}
         </>
       );
     };
     ```

**Using `useCallback` (Optional Advanced Topic)**

- **Purpose:** Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creation.
- **Example:**

  ```jsx
  const onToggle = useCallback(
    (id) => {
      toggleReminder(id);
    },
    [toggleReminder]
  );
  ```

### **2. Debugging and Developer Tools**

#### **- Using React Developer Tools Extension**

**Installation:**

- **Chrome:** Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools).
- **Firefox:** Install from the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/).

**Features:**

- **Component Hierarchy:** View the structure of your React components.
- **Props and State Inspection:** Examine props and state of each component.
- **Performance Profiling:** Analyze rendering performance.

**Using the Tools:**

1. **Open Developer Tools:**

   - Right-click on the page and select "Inspect," then navigate to the "Components" tab.

2. **Inspect Components:**

   - Click on components to view their props and state.

3. **Debugging State Changes:**

   - Use the tools to observe how state changes in response to user interactions.

#### **- Common Debugging Techniques**

**Console Logging:**

- Use `console.log()` to output values and track code execution.

  ```jsx
  const addTask = (task) => {
    console.log('Adding task:', task);
    // rest of the code
  };
  ```

**Error Boundaries:**

- Catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree.

  ```jsx
  // Create an ErrorBoundary component
  class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { hasError: false };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
      // Update state to render fallback UI
      return { hasError: true };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, info) {
      // Log error details
      console.error(error, info);
    }

    render() {
      if (this.state.hasError) {
        return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
      }
      return this.props.children;
    }
  }

  // Use it in App.js
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <App />
  </ErrorBoundary>;
  ```

**Using Breakpoints:**

- Set breakpoints in your code using the browser's developer tools to pause execution and inspect variables.

### **3. Deployment Process**

#### **- Preparing the App for Production Build**

**Optimizing for Production:**

- **Build the App:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **What This Does:**

  - Creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.
  - Minifies the code and optimizes for best performance.

**Analyzing the Bundle Size:**

- **Install `source-map-explorer`:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g source-map-explorer
  ```

- **Analyze the Bundle:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'
  ```

- **Purpose:**

  - Identifies large dependencies.
  - Helps optimize and reduce bundle size.

#### **- Deploying to Netlify**

**1. Creating a Netlify Account:**

- Sign up at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

**2. Deploying the App:**

- **Option 1: Drag and Drop**

  - Drag the `build` folder into the Netlify dashboard.

- **Option 2: Connect to GitHub**

  - Push your code to GitHub.
  - In Netlify, click on "New site from Git."
  - Select GitHub and authenticate.
  - Choose your repository.
  - Set the build command to `npm run build`.
  - Set the publish directory to `build`.

**3. Configure Routing (Optional):**

- Create a `_redirects` file in the `public` folder.

  ```
  /*    /index.html   200
  ```

- Ensures that client-side routing works correctly.

#### **- Deploying to Vercel**

**1. Creating a Vercel Account:**

- Sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

**2. Deploying the App:**

- Install Vercel CLI:

  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```

- Deploy:

  ```bash
  vercel
  ```

- Follow the prompts to select the project and configure settings.

#### **- Deploying to GitHub Pages**

**1. Install `gh-pages` Package:**

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

**2. Update `package.json`:**

- Add the following properties:

  ```json
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
  ```

- Add scripts:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
  ```

**3. Deploy:**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**4. Configure GitHub Repository:**

- Go to your repository settings.
- Enable GitHub Pages and set the source to `gh-pages` branch.

5. **Patch App Routing for GitHub Pages:**

   - Replace `BrowserRouter` with `HashRouter` in the routing setup.

    ```javascript
     // src/index.js
     import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
    ```

   - In the `package.json` set the `homepage` field.

    ```json
     // src/App.js
     "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
    ```
