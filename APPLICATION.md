**Application to Build Throughout the Series: A Personal Task Manager App**

Throughout the five-part series, you'll be building a **Personal Task Manager**â€”a to-do list application that allows users to:

- **Add New Tasks:** Input task names and descriptions.
- **View Task List:** Display all tasks in a clean, organized manner.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete or Incomplete:** Toggle the status of each task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Filter Tasks:** View tasks based on their completion status (e.g., all tasks, completed, pending).
- **Navigate Between Pages:** Use React Router to switch between different views within the app.

**Why This App?**

- **Beginner-Friendly:** It's simple enough for newcomers to grasp basic concepts.
- **Core React Features:** Covers essential topics like components, props, state, and hooks.
- **Advanced Concepts:** Provides a foundation to introduce context API, routing, and performance optimization.
- **Practical Use:** Creates a functional tool that viewers can use and expand upon after the series.

**How It Aligns with the Series:**

- **Video 1:** Set up the development environment and initialize the React project for the task manager app.
- **Video 2:** Create reusable components like TaskItem and TaskList, and pass data using props.
- **Video 3:** Manage the state of tasks using hooks like `useState` and handle user interactions.
- **Video 4:** Implement global state management with Context API and add routing for different views (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks).
- **Video 5:** Optimize the app for better performance and deploy it to a hosting service so others can access it.

By the end of the series, you'll have a fully functional task manager application deployed online, demonstrating both fundamental and advanced React concepts.
